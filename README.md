# WebDev Architecture

What is a good Architecture?
How to create better Web Apps, and what makes an App Good?

There is Stuff we see and Stuff we don't see. 

The Stuff we see is the View-Layer of an Application. The GUI, the Design, the though given into Colors, UX and UI.
But the Stuff what we don't often see is the Logic Layer. All the things which happen on the Background without us even noticing.
And this Stuff is imporant. The Problem? This Stuff changes. Often. 

Back in the day there were a lot of Problems seperating Logic and UI Elements from each other. Than came Programming patterns like MVC (Model View Controller) which gave a Simple Solution for avoiding confusion and give clearer separation of concerns in the Code. 

## What are the main Struggles of WebDevelopers Today?

You would guess it's writing code. But i guess writing code is the least problematic part of writing Apps.

The biggest Problem in Web is the change in modern WebDev which happens every 2-3 Years.
